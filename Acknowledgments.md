This code is built upon the foundational work of Samson Zhang. The original version can be found on his page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/input).

## Modifications and Enhancements

The following modifications and enhancements have been made:

- Improved parameters initiation for weights and biases, incorporating a scaling factor.
- Code optimizations for activation functions.
- **Hidden Layers Implementation:** Introducing 4 different hidden layers of 8, 16, 32, and 64 neurons, implemented one by one. This required necessary changes in the code, specifically in the generation of weights and biases.

- **Neural Network Performance Visualization:** Implementing code for visualizing the neural network performance for each hidden layer with a specified number of neurons.

- **Accuracy Evaluation and Comparison:** Evaluating and comparing the accuracies of each hidden layer on the tested data.

- **Matplotlib Visualization:** Generating important charts using Matplotlib to visualize the performance and outputs of each hidden layer.
